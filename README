########################## Building TeamDRH Roms ##############################

##### Set Up Android Source Tree #####

Initialize your local Android source tree by following the instructions at:

http://source.android.com/source/downloading.html

The TeamDRH repos are currently set up to work with the 4.0.3 source branch.
To select this branch when you do your repo init, use the following cmd.

$ repo init -u https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest -b android-4.0.3_r1

Next, pull in the local manifest that will add the TeamDRH repos:

$ git clone git://github.com/TeamDRH/local_manifest_malata.git
$ cp local_manifest_malata/local_manifest.xml .repo

Then sync to pull the remote repos to your local source tree:

$ repo sync

After sync is complete (this will take a while), pull the patches repo:

$ git clone git://github.com/TeamDRH/ics_patches.git

Follow the README in the ics_patches directory to install patches, then
set up the build environment:

$ . build/envsetup.sh

Then choose the lunch target:

$ lunch TeamDRH_smba1002-eng

Now do a make otapackage to build the ROM ( "-jN" selects "N" number of threads to run)

$ make -j4 otapackage

Once again, this will take a while, when you have a successful build, you can
run squisher to do some final setup, optimization, and cleanup.

$ ./vendor/TeamDRH/tools/squisher

This completes the build process. The final script will output the ROM location.
